## An annotation is a simple value object

You will always find annotations inside so-called doc blocks, which are basically comments but
they start with /**. Regular annotations start with @ and serve as documentation for the code that
immediately follows it, like this:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @param int $id The ID of the user
 * @return array Template variables
 */
public function editAction($id)
{
    ...
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When parsing a doc block, the Doctrine annotation reader will skip all regular annotations,
like @param and @return, based on a pre-configured list. When an annotation is not on that list,
the annotation reader will assume that the annotation is a class name. For example, the @Route
annotation of the UserController::editAction() in the code sample below is actually a class
name: Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route, which has been imported by
the use statement:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route;

class UserController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/users/{id}/edit", name="user.edit")
     */
    public function editAction($id)
    {
        ...
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The annotation reader will try to create an instance of that class and fill it with the data between
the brackets ("/users/{id}/edit", name="user.edit"). The resulting Route object can then be
used by the routing loader to add an extra route to the RouteCollection.

In every Symfony application an instance of the Doctrine annotation reader is already available
as the annotation_reader service:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
// get the service container
$container = ...

$reader = $container->get('annotation_reader');
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To parse the doc block of the UserController::editAction() we need to create a [reflection
object](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.reflection.php) for that method first:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
$method = new \ReflectionMethod('UserController', 'editAction');
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then we can ask the annotation reader to parse the annotations of the reflected method:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
$annotations = $reader->getMethodAnnotations($method);
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The result of parsing the method annotations would be an array with one Route object. The
object properties contain the attributes that were provided with the @Route annotation:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
print_r($annotations);

/*
Array
(
    [0] => Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Route Object
        (
            ...
            [path]
                => /users/{id}/edit
            [name]
                => user.edit
            ...
        )
)
*/
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each annotation class (like the Route class) needs to have an @Annotation annotation itself in
order to be recognized by the annotation reader as a valid annotation:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the @Annotation annotation in place, the MyAnnotation class can be used as a real
annotation for a class, a method or a property:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @MyAnnotation
 */
class SomeClass
{
    /**
     * @MyAnnotation
     */
    private $someProperty;

    /**
     * @MyAnnotation
     */
    public function someFunction()
    {
    }

    /**
     * @MyAnnotation(@MyAnnotation)
     */
    public function otherFunction()
    {
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is even possible to use @MyAnnotation inside another @MyAnnotation, as you can see inside the
doc block of SomeClass::otherFunction().
When we ask the annotation reader to parse the class annotations for SomeClass, it will return
an array with one object: an instance of MyAnnotation:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
// get the annotation reader
$reader = ...

$class = new \ReflectionClass('SomeClass');
$annotations = $reader->getClassAnnotations($class);

print_r($annotations);

/*
Array(
    [0] => MyAnnotation object
)
*/
~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Adding attributes to your annotation

To be able to define your own annotations is already very nice, but they become more useful
when you store some data inside them. This data can be provided by the user when they add your
annotation to one of their classes, methods, etc.
The annotation parser supports many different kinds of syntaxes for populating the attributes of
an annotation. It accepts strings, numbers, boolean values, arrays and objects (which are themselves
annotations). For example:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @MyAnnotation(
 *   "some string",
 *   "hashMap" = {
 *       "key" = "value"
 *    },
 *   "booleanValue" = true,
 *   "nestedAnnotation" = @MyAnnotation
 * )
 */
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any logical combination of types is possible. For instance, it’s possible to put each scalar or
object type inside a hash map.
When the user has provided some data for the annotation, like in the example above, the
annotation reader needs to pass that data to the annotation object it creates. There are two different
strategies which the annotation parser can apply.

#### Passing the attributes via the constructor

First, the annotation parser will look inside the MyAnnotation class for the presence of a constructor.
If it finds one, it passes all the attributes as the first argument of the constructor when it creates an
instance of the MyAnnotation class:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
    public function __construct(array $attributes)
    {
        // "some string"
        $value = $attributes['value'];

        // array('key' => 'value', ...)
        $hashMap = $attributes['hashMap'];

        // true
        $booleanValue = $attributes['booleanValue'];

        // an instance of MyAnnotation
        $nestedAnnotation = $attributes['nestedAnnotation'];
    }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

From then on you can do anything you like with those values. You would probably validate them
and store them in private properties.

#### Populating public properties with the provided attributes

If there is no constructor (or the constructor has no first argument), the parser will try to copy the
attributes that were provided into public properties of the MyAnnotation class:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
    public $value;
    public $hashMap;
    public $booleanValue;
    public $nestedAnnotation;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using this second strategy you have no chance to validate the attributes before they are copied
into the public properties. Luckily it is possible to add some basic validation rules directly inside the
annotation class itself.

#### Validation using @Attributes

We can add an @Attributes annotation to the MyAnnotation class. It accepts an array of @Attribute
annotations that can be used to describe each supported attribute: the type of value that is expected,
and whether or not the attribute is required.

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 * @Attributes({
 * @Attribute("value", type="string", required=true),
 * @Attribute("hashMap", type="array<string>", required=false),
 * @Attribute("booleanValue", type="boolean"),
 * @Attribute("nestedAnnotation", type="MyAnnotation")
 * })
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
    public $value;
    public $hashMap;
    public $booleanValue;
    public $nestedAnnotation;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default attributes are not required. When an optional attribute has not been provided, its value
will be null. When an attribute is of type array then the value that is provided will be converted to
an array automatically, so "some string value" becomes array("some string value").

#### Validation using @var and @Required

The validation options provided by using the @Attributes annotation are very useful. But if you
don’t like the fact that the rules for each property are not directly above that property’s definition,
you can also choose not to use @Attributes and instead add type declarations for each property:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
    /**
     * @var string
     * @Required
     */
    public $value;

    /**
     * @var array<string>
     */
    public $hashMap;

    /**
     * @var boolean
     */
    public $booleanValue;

    /**
     * @var MyAnnotation
     */
    public $nestedAnnotation;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To mark an attribute of the annotation as required, add @Required to the doc block above the
corresponding property.

There is one nice option that adds a little extra to the validation process: the @Enum annotation.
You can use it to define which values are allowed for a given attribute. This annotation has to be in
the doc block of the relevant property. It works in combination with the @Attributes annotation as
well as with the @var validation:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
    /**
     * @Enum({"yes", "no"})
     */
    $answer;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now @MyAnnotation(answer="yes") would be valid, while MyAnnotation(answer="unsure")
would trigger an error.

### Limiting the use of an annotation

Different kinds of annotations have different use cases. For instance, the @Entity annotation from
the Doctrine ORM does only make sense for classes, not for methods. On the other hand, the
@Template annotation from the SensioFrameworkExtraBundle should only be used for methods,
not for classes. Likewise, some annotations can only be applied to properties, like @Type from the
JMS Serializer. And some annotations can only be applied inside another annotation as one of its
attributes, like the @Attribute annotation that can only occur inside an @Attributes annotation.
These different use cases are called “targets” and we can configure them ourselves per annotation
class, by adding a @Target annotation to it:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 * @Target("CLASS")
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The available targets are: CLASS, METHOD, PROPERTY, ANNOTATION and ALL (which is the default
target for annotations if you don’t specify it). If an annotation has multiple targets, you can provide
them as an array of strings:

{lang="php"}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
/**
 * @Annotation
 * @Target({"CLASS", "METHOD"})
 */
class MyAnnotation
{
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~
