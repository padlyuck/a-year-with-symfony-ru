## Состояния и контекст

Services can be divided in two groups:

1. Static services
2. Dynamic services

The majority of the services defined in your service container are in the first category. A static
service does the same thing over and over again. Maybe the first time a bit more inefficient. But given
the same input, it does the same thing and the result will be the same too. Think about sending a
mail using the mailer service, or storing an object using an entity manager.

The second category contains services that have some volatility: when you use a dynamic service,
you don’t know in advance if it works as expected, since it may depend on the current request, or
in the case of a Symfony application: on the fact that the kernel is currently handling a request.

### 9.1 The security context

One obvious example of a dynamic service is the security context. Whether or not it will give you
a user object when you call ->getToken()->getUser() on it, depends on many things, especially
on the request and if the firewall can derive if there is a user currently logged in. However, many
services I’ve seen, have a dependency on the security context, like this one:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\SecurityContextInterface;

class UserMailer
{
    private $securityContext;
    private $mailer;

    public function __construct(
        SecurityContextInterface $securityContext,
        \SwiftMailer $mailer
    ) {
        $this->securityContext = $securityContext;
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }

    public function sendMailToCurrentUser($subject, $body)
    {
        $token = $this->securityContext->getToken();
        if (!($token instanceof TokenInterface)) {
            // we are not behind a firewall
            return;
        }

        $user = $token->getUser();
        if (!($user instanceof User)) {
            // no logged in user
            return;
        }

        $message = \Swift_Message::newInstance()
            ->setTo($user->getEmailAddress())
            ->setSubject($subject)
            ->setBody($messageBody);

        $this->get('mailer')->send($message);
    }
}
```

The service definition for this class looks like:

```xml
<service id="user_mailer" class="UserMailer">
    <argument type="service" id="security.context" />
    <argument type="service" id="mailer" />
</service>
```

Inside a controller you can do this to send a message to the current user (the @Secure annotation
will make sure there is an authenticated user and he has the role ROLE_USER):

```php
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\Controller;
use JMS\SecurityExtraBundle\Annotation\Secure;

class SomeController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @Secure("ROLE_USER")
     */
    public function sendMailAction()
    {
        $this->get('user_mailer')->sendMailToCurrentUser('Hi', 'there!');
    }
}
```

Why is this bad? Well, there we go:

1. The user_mailer service can only be used for sending mails to the current user.
There is however nothing specific about the current user in comparison with other users. The
sendMailToCurrentUser($subject, $body) method could easily be changed to sendMailTo(User
$user, $subject, $body). This makes your class much more generic and reusable.
2. The user_mailer service can only be used during the lifetime of a request which is secured
by a firewall.

When requesting the user_mailer from within a console command, the service would
therefore be totally useless, even though you may still want to send a message to a user.
The solution to the first problem solves this problem without any extra effort.

So let’s change the UserMailer class to this:

```php
class UserMailer
{
    private $mailer;

    public function __construct(\SwiftMailer $mailer)
    {
        $this->mailer = $mailer;
    }

    public function sendMailToUser(User $user, $subject, $body)
    {
        $message = \Swift_Message::newInstance()
            ->setTo($user->getEmailAddress())
            ->setSubject($subject)
            ->setBody($body);

        $this->mailer->send($message);
    }
}
```

The result is a smaller class and much cleaner code. From now on the user_mailer service has
no idea to which user it should send a mail (which is good): you always need to provide a User
object, which may or may not be the current user.

The controller is an excellent place to determine the current user, since we know that a controller
is only executed during the handling of a request, and we know that it is behind a firewall, when
we have explicitly configured it to be. So there should be a “current user” (provided that our firewall
configuration is correct) and now we can do this:

```php
class SomeController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * @Secure("ROLE_USER")
     */
    public function sendMailAction()
    {
        $user = $this->getUser();

        $this->get('user_mailer')->sendMailTo($user, 'Hi', 'there!');
    }
}
```

> Whenever you want to do something in a service only for the current user, it’s better to
> provide the user from the outside, as an argument or maybe even using a setter method,
> then to fetch the user using the SecurityContext inside the service.

### 9.2 The request

The security context is populated with the user token once per request, but only for the master
request. But other services you create may depend on the current Request object, which is different
for master and sub-requests. This Request object is available as the request service, which is a
dynamic service. There is a time (in fact: before the kernel is asked to handle the request) when this
request service is even unavailable and can not be used by any other object as a dependency. In fact,
there is also a time when there is more than one request service, namely when the kernel handles
a sub-request.

Inside the service container this problem is solved using the notion of scope. The container can
enter and leave scopes and at the moment of the transition between scopes, the previous service
will be recovered, or a new service should be provided for the new scope. In the case of the request
service, these are the executive states the container will be in:

1. The container is in container scope, the request service is undefined.
2. The kernel handles the main request, it instructs the container to enter the request scope and
sets the request service.
3. The kernel handles a sub-request, it instructs the container to enter a new request scope and
sets the sub-request as the request service.
4. The kernel finishes the sub-request, it instructs the container to leave the request scope. The
previous request service will be restored.
5. The kernel finishes the main request and instructs the container to leave the request scope.
The request service will be undefined again.

This way, whenever you call $container->get('request') you “always” retrieve the current
Request object. When you need to have the request service available in one of your own objects,
there are [multiple ways](http://symfony.com/doc/2.8/service_container/scopes.html) to do this which I all strongly discourage.

It is not evil per se to need the request to be able to perform a certain action. But you should not
depend on the request as a service. Say you want to do something like logging access to pages:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;

class PageCounter
{
    private $counter;

    public function __construct(Request $request)
    {
        $this->request = $request;
    }

    public function incrementPageCounter()
    {
        $uri = $this->request->getPathInfo();

        // somehow increment the page counter for this URI
        ...
    }
}
```

With the corresponding service definition:

```xml
<service id="page_counter" class="PageCounter" scope="request">
    <argument type="service" id="request" />
</service>
```

Since you depend on the request service, your entire service itself should also have the scope
request.

Inside a controller you would now call:

```php
class InterestingController extends Controller
{
    public function indexAction()
    {
        $this->get('page_counter')->incrementPageCounter();
    }
}
```

Of course the page_counter service is able to find out the URI of the current page since it has
the entire Request object. But now:

1. Statistics can only be gathered during the current request.
When the kernel is done with handling the request, the request service itself will be set to
null and the page counter becomes useless.

2. The PageCounter class is now tightly coupled to the Request class.
The counter only needs to have some URI. This URI does not necessarily have to come from a
Request object. It would be better to pass it as an argument to the incrementPageCounter()
method:
    ```php
    public function incrementPageCounter($uri)
    {
        ...
    }
    ```

These two problems can seem far-fetched. But it is very probable that one day you need to
import old page count data collected in some other way, and then you need to manually call the
incrementPageCounter(). It will then help you very much that it is not so tightly coupled to the
Request class.

#### Avoiding a dependency on the current request

There are two major strategies for avoiding your services to be somehow dependent on the current
request:

##### Use an event listener

As you may remember from the first chapter: the kernel always dispatches a kernel.request event
for each request it handles. At that moment, you can use an event listener to do something that you
want to do for every request, like increment a page counter, or maybe [prevent further execution by
throwing an exception](http://php-and-symfony.matthiasnoback.nl/2012/12/prevent-controller-execution-with-annotations-and-return-a-custom-response/).

```php
class PageCounterListener
{
    private $counter;

    public function __construct(PageCounter $counter)
    {
        $this->counter = $counter;
    }

    public function onKernelRequest(GetResponseEvent $event)
    {
        $request = $event->getRequest();

        $this->counter->incrementPageCounter($request->getPathInfo());
    }
}
```

##### Providing the request object at runtime

When you do need the entire Request object it is always better to start from a place where you know
this object exists (and you can retrieve it reliably) and from that moment on pass it around to other
services:

```php
class SomeController extends Controller
{
    public function indexAction(Request $request)
    {
        $this->get('page_counter')->handle($request);
    }
}
```

> ##### Request matchers
> 
> In many situations in which you need the Request object inside your service, you might
> use it to perform some kind of matching on it. You could then abstract the matching logic
> using a request matcher:
> 
> ```php
> use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestMatcherInterface;
> use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
> 
> class MyRequestMatcher implements RequestMatcherInterface
> {
>     public function matches(Request $request)
>     {
>         return $request->getClientIp() === '127.0.0.1';
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Or use the standard RequestMatcher:
> 
> ```php
> use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\RequestMatcher;
> 
> $matcher = new RequestMatcher();
> $matcher->matchIp('127.0.0.1');
> // $matcher->matchPath('^/secure');
> ...
> 
> if ($matcher->matches($request)) {
>     ...
> }
> ```

##### Using specific values only

Before passing through an entire Request object, always ask yourself: do I really need all this
information? Or do I need only one particular bit? If so, decouple your class from the Request
class and adapt the arguments:

Change this:

```php
class AccessLogger
{
    public function logAccess(Request $request)
    {
        $ipAddress = $request->getClientIp();

        // log the IP address
        ...
    }
}
```

Into:

```php
class AccessLogger
{
    public function logAccess($ipAddress)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

This makes your code reusable in other projects that don’t use the Symfony HttpFoundation
Component. See also [Reduce coupling to the framework](#TODO).
