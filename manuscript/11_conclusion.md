## Conclusion

Though not from request to response, this has been quite a journey! I wrote the first pages of this
book in April of 2013. In June I said it would take just 6 more weeks to finish it. Well, it took three
months, but now it is exactly as I had imagined it to be: a book for developers familiar with Symfony,
wanting to take an extra step. Now that you’ve finished the book, I hope that you found it interesting.
And maybe you can use some of the practices described here in your work as a developer.

    Since this is the last page of the book, it’s time for some meta-comments!
    
I think that the PHP community has taken some huge steps in the last couple of years. There are
some great tools and platforms now, like GitHub and Composer, Vagrant and Puppet. PHP developers
are becoming aware of the commonality of their individual ideas (for instance as expressed by the
PSR-* standards). They have also slowly started to take care of handling version numbers well (e.g.
semantic versioning). And they are generally very much concerned about bugs in their open-sourced
software (which other people use in production environments). Above all, many PHP developers
contribute to open-source projects for free, which generates a good vibe and a great tradition of
giving and sharing.

But PHP developers are not used to all of the activities related to working with or even delivering
open-source software: defining a manageable list of package dependencies, distributing packages,
releasing software to the world, announcing changes to an API, handling bugs reported by strangers,
working with continuous integration, etc.

More importantly: developing software for reusability has proven to be quite a difficult task in
itself. Luckily, there are many principles you can adhere to. Some of them are described in the last
part of this book. And some of them are well known to people writing in other languages than PHP.
See for instance the list of [package design principles](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod) 
as described by Robert Martin. Ideas like these are not known to everyone in the PHP community, while they should be. 
If I were to ever write a book again, it would be about that: PHP package design.
